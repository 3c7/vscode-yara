# Symbol References
Finds all references for a symbol selected in a YARA rule.

## Variables
If the symbol is a variable, only the local rule is searched.

![][ref]

## Rules
If the symbol is a rule name, the entire file is searched.

![][refrule]

## Wildcards
Variable wildcards are a special case; attempting to resolve their references shows the reference for all variables that that wildcard covers.
