# Hovers
Hovering over a variable displays its associated definition.

**Please note**: Hovers do not cover rule names even though the definition provider does.
I've been thinking about using metadata (description, purpose, etc.), but this varies so much between users that it would be difficult to reliably gather the correct term. Maybe in the future.
