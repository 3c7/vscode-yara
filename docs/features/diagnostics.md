# Diagnostics Provider
YARA rule files are compiled in the background, and errors and warnings are displayed back to the screen as diagnostics data.

For more information on what errors and warnings can be thrown, see [the YARA documentation](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writingrules.html).
