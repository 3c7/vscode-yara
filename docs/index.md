# YARA for Visual Studio Code
Rich language support for the YARA pattern matching language

This repository was formerly listed as [textmate-yara](https://github.com/infosec-intern/textmate-yara). It is being moved to [vscode-yara](https://github.com/infosec-intern/vscode-yara) to keep more in-line with the features provided by the extension. It is now more than just colorization support, and I believe the title should reflect that.

## Features

* [Code Completion](./features/code_completion.md)
* [Commands](./features/commands.md)
